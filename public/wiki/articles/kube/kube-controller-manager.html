<h2>kube-controller-manager</h2>
<p>(aka Controller Manager): <b>Control plane component that runs controller processes</b>.</p>
<p>Logically, each controller is a separate process, but to reduce complexity, they are all compiled into a single binary and run in a single process.</p>
There are many different types of controllers. Some examples of them are:
<ul>
 <li><b>Node controller</b>: Responsible for noticing and responding when nodes go down.</li>
 <li><b>Job controller</b>: Watches for Job objects that represent one-off tasks, then creates Pods to run those tasks to completion.</li>
 <li><b>EndpointSlice controller</b>: Populates EndpointSlice objects (to provide a link between Services and Pods).</li>
 <li><b>ServiceAccount controller</b>: Create default ServiceAccounts for new namespaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above is not an exhaustive list.</p>
