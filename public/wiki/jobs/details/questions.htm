 <ul>
 	<li>1st ever employer FFD: Delivering a reporting engine with its own built-in language to allow complex relational and field processing
 		within the report tool. It allowed some clever formatting of output types too (similar to spreadsheet format options).
 	    This app lasted for a good 10 years and was sunset when new technology allowed standard off-the-shelf tools like this.</li>
    <li>2nd ever employer Dialogue: Winning an award for best mobile app of the year - a Xerox field operatives notification app using SMS</li>
    <li>Zillow: Developed a smart search/reporting API for property listing from disparate data sources and APIs.</li>
    <li>HF/Edifecs: Stabilized their legacy suspect generation engine; built the replacement running in the cloud</li>

<tr><td>12</td><td>Can you explain your employment gap?</td><td>18 months after company takeover they had a 3rd round of layoffs and included me. 
  The economic climate for tech was causing multiple layoffs from other bay area companies which lead to a lot of free talent on the marget. So after applying 100+ jobs I only got 3 interviews. I was over qualified for one and was not selected for the 2 others.

<tr><td>13</td><td>What are your salary expectations?</td><td>Anything 120K - 240K and other benefits play into that</td></tr>
<tr><td>14</td><td>What do you like to do outside of work?</td><td> Play guitar, golf, travel, art and craft.</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Tell me about a time you had to manage conflicting priorities.</td><td> This often happens. For example the inherited legacy codebase across many moving parts was problematic. This often lead to emergencies - particulary when new clients were being onboarded - so a change in priority was quite a frequent occurence. This required checking with my supervisor about impact and timing so we could assess best options - rather than just dropping everything. See answer to 23.</td></tr>
<tr><td>16</td><td>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</td><td> As a staff engineer assisting multiple teams possibly - certainly using my tech skills to mentor team, provide critical vision for project on product management and continuing to stay in touch with latest tech.</td></tr>
<tr><td>17</td><td>Describe your leadership style.</td><td> I treat everyone with respect. I strive to be a good example to colleagues  and support my reports and all necessary staff to level up their skills/knowledge. I listen carefully to all staff, consider their points of view and foster good relations with people. With product management I try to win their trust by (a) delivering on promises, (b) helping them make decisions about requirements, (c) advising them of any problems and (d) go the extra mile to achieve the company goals. This is the job to me... and of course always try to follow company mantra.</td></tr>
<tr><td>18</td><td>Tell me about a time you failed or made a mistake.</td><td> In a code test interview about finding the nearest date for a flight I used an ordered map. This was the correct approach and to complete the task all I need to do was use a function called "floor" that gets the nearest element (i.e. flight date less than or equal to a given key date). I had never used that function and was trying to think of a way to avoid a scan but we had run out of time. The developer running the test failed me as a consequence. In real life you would easily figure this out. In general when I test candidates I don't penalize them for not knowing one thing - I am interested in what they can do and how they think. This is the spirit of collaboration to me. It takes but a minute to find a suitable function if one exists - and about ten minutes to write your own version if
one doesn't exist. Anyhow - lesson learned - make sure you know the standard functions available for all your typical data structures.</td></tr>
<tr><td>19</td><td>Tell me about a time you worked with a difficult person.</td><td>
<ul>
  <li>I worked with a report who thought a loop was bad coding (some quote about infinite convolutions or something he had
    picked up). He got quite aggressive about it and was reprimanded by my manager for improper comments on an email.
    I considered his comments and decided it best to let him put forward his own fix to this part of the solution.
    It was impossible to avoid some kind of iterative loop but he made a couple of changes of which allowed him to save face
    and we moved on.</li>
  <li>I worked a temporary contract as a senior developer reporting to one of two CEO's who owned the business
    - the technical CEO was my effective manager.
    A junior employee put together some duff code that got released causing issues.
    It was not my job to manage staff or to test, review or release their work - but the non-tech CEO 
    decided that I should be held responsible for this and went ballistic at me. Sigh.
    I just waited for him to finish shouting and then calmly asked him what he wanted me to do next to resolve the issue.
    Lesson - the blame game is a stupid way to run a business and solves nothing.
    I was happy this was a short contract.
  </li>
</ul>

<tr><td>20</td><td>Tell me about a time you had to persuade someone.</td><td>This is a standard part of the job.
  I had to persuade my boss and team lead that a solution was correct and not worth another week of pointless work.
  We held a meeting with the 3 of us to ensure we all understood the problem and solution - and
  we agreed that the code was good.    
</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>Tell me about a time you disagreed with someone.</td><td>This often occurs and
  I handle disagreements with an open mind - discussing to explore the possibilities.
  I have learned many things this way - including that my own biases are not always the best way forward.
  For eaxmple - we had to solve a speed issue in presenting a list of patient appointments. 
  A design flaw was caused by using all backend microservices and APIs based on NoSQL for all entities and not having
  any easy SQL solution for handling relationships. The design was great for Service Oriented design, data updates
  and scalability - but not for any reporting or providing a list of appointments and diagnosis summary.
  I deferred to the tech director who wished to avoid creating any duplicate (denormalized) table.
  Instead I enhanced the design to cache results, preload data and keep these caches warm.
  In the end the trade off was quite a good solution and good lessons were learned. 
  Conclusion: <b>discuss and evaluate all views without bias</b>.

<tr><td>22</td><td>Tell me about a time you created a goal and achieved it.</td><td> At Apple i proposed we get 90% code test coverage. We acheived this. </td></tr>
<tr><td>23</td><td>Tell me about a time you surpassed people’s expectations.</td><td> At Edifecs someone convinced a client that to reload their documents for the last 2 years would be OK and would take a short time. This represented over 10 million documents included ongoing daily updates. Unfortunately they did not realize our legacy system could not process this amount of data and repopulate all the patient states within the expected time frame (a week or so). To resolve this I created a way to multi-thread the legacy system and created a rapid import system that could call their system to fetch the documents at a rapid rate. The time taken was 20% of predicted - keeping this important customer happy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>24</td><td>Tell me about a time you had to handle pressure.</td><td>See above: our customer was a valued client and they were pretty agressive with us on this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Tell me about a time you had to learn something quickly.</td><td>oauth for continued client document ingestion.</td></tr>
<tr><td>26</td><td>Do you have any questions for me?</td><td>
<ul>
	<li>How do you see the company changing within the next 3 years?</li>
	<li>E.g. Do you expect the tech department will grow or will it stay as a relatively small start-up?</li>
