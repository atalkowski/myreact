<h2>Top 10 Python Libraries</h2>
See this original page if it is still available: <a href="https://www.naukri.com/code360/library/python-libraries">Python Libraries</a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In this section, we are going to discuss the Python Libraries their function and some features of these libraries. But, before discussing Python Libraries, firstly we must have a better understanding of the terms like “Modules” and “Packages”.</p>
<p>A Module is a file which contains some Python code whereas the term Packages state that it is a directory of sub-packages and modules. After having a better understanding of these two we shift our discussion to the Python Libraries. So, A Library is a collection of files (known as Modules) that contains functions for use by other programs. It means that Python Libraries are a reusable piece of code that we can add to our programmes.</p>
<p>They may also contain data values like numerical constants and other things. Library’s contents are supposed to be related, but there’s no way to enforce that. The Python standard library is an extensive suite of modules that comes with Python itself. Many additional libraries are available from PyPI (the Python Package Index) and from here we can conclude that a package is a library that can be installed using a package manager like RubyGems or npm.</p>
<h2>How Python Libraries work</h2>
<p>Python libraries work by providing a collection of pre-written code modules that users can import into their programs. These libraries contain functions, classes, and constants that offer specific functionalities, ranging from numerical computing and data manipulation to web scraping and machine learning. When a library is imported into a Python script or program, its modules become accessible, allowing users to leverage the provided functionalities to accomplish their tasks efficiently. Libraries often rely on dependencies and external packages, which are automatically installed or managed using package managers like pip. By incorporating Python libraries into their projects, developers can streamline development, reduce code duplication, and benefit from the collective expertise of the Python community.
</p>
<h3>Python Standard Library</h3>
<p>The Python standard library is a collection of modules bundled with the Python programming language. These modules are available for use without taking external installations or downloads. The standard library delivers developers with different functionalities and tools. It covers areas like network communication, data manipulation, mathematics, debugging, regular expressions, and more. 
</p>
<p>The Python Standard Library is like an expansive collection of tools and resources that come with Python. It includes everything you need to write programs, like commands, functions, and ways to handle input and output. Access to the Python Standard Library makes Python a robust programming language. 
</p>
<p>The standard library modules can be imported into Python programs using the import statement. It let the developers to access the functions, classes, and objects delivered by these modules. Proper documentation is available for the Python standard library. It offers precise and clear information to use these modules effectively. Developers greatly benefit from the Python standard library. As it provides a large number of tools that significantly enhance productivity and streamline the development process of Python applications.

<h3>List of Top 10 Libraries in Python (2023)
</h3>
<ul>
 <li><b>1. Matplotlib:</b> It is one of very important Python Library which helps us to deal with data analysing and is a numerical plotting library. Actually It is a Python 2D plotting library which produces quality figures in a variety of Hardcopy Formats and interactive environment across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python Scripts, Python and Python shell. It tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. In this, we can generate plots, Histograms, Power Spectra etc with the few lines of codes.</li>
 <li><b>2. NumPy:</b> It is one of the fundamental Library of Python, which has advanced math functions and a package of scientific computing with Python. It is useful for linear Algebra, Fourier Transformation and other various complex Mathematical functions.NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data, arbitrary data types are also defined in NumPy which makes it speedily integrate with a wide variety of database.</li>
 <li><b>3. Pandas:</b> Pandas, an open-source library, operates under the BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) license. It is used for Data Science. It is used for Data Analysis purposes as it provides fast, expressive and flexible data structures to easily work with structured and time-series data in Python Programming Language.</li>
 <li><b>4. Scipy:</b> This library of Python is most popular, as we have been reading so much about this. It is just another form which may be used in place of NumPy. They use NumPy for more mathematical functions. SciPy uses NumPy arrays as their basic data structure and comes with modules for various commonly used task in scientific Programming, including Ordinary differential equations solving and signal processing.</li>
 <li><b>5. PyGame:</b> It is a set of Python modules which is used to create video games. It consists of computer graphics and sound libraries that are designed to be used with the Python programming language. Pygame was officially written by Pete Shinners to replace PySDL. Pygame is suitable to create client-side applications that can be potentially wrapped in a standalone executable.</li>
 <li><b>6. Pyglet:</b> It is a cross-platform windowing and multimedia library for python. Pyglet is an excellent choice for an object-oriented programming interface in developing games. In fact, it also finds use in developing other visually-rich applications for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux. In the 90s, when people were bored, they resorted to playing Minecraft on their computers. Pyglet is the engine behind Minecraft.</li>
 <li><b>7. Scrapy:</b> If your motive is fast, high-level screen scraping and web crawling, then go for Scrapy. It is used to crawl websites and extract structured data from their pages. It can be used for a wide range of purposes, from data mining to monitoring and automated testing.</li>
 <li><b>8. SymPy:</b> It is an open-source library for symbolic mathematics. With very simple and comprehensible code that is easily extensible, SymPy is a full-fledged Computer Algebra System (CAS). It is written in Python and hence does not need external libraries.</li>
 <li><b>9. Fabric:</b> Along with being a library, Fabric is a command-line tool for streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks. Fabric is very simple and powerful and can help to automate repetitive command-line tasks. This approach can save time by automating our entire workflow. With Fabric, we can execute local or remote shell commands, upload/download files, and even prompt running user for input, or abort execution.</li>
 <li><b>10. Pillow:</b> It is a Python Imaging Library(PIL), which adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving images. The current version identifies and reads a large number of formats. Pillow allows us to get some basic information about images.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use of Libraries in Python Program</h3>
<p>When writing large-scale Python projects, we want to keep the code modular. We split the code into different portions for easier maintenance, and we may use that code whenever we need it. Modules fill that role in Python. Instead of using the same code in several projects and complicating the code, we construct commonly used functions as modules and simply import them into a program wherever they are needed.
</p>
<p>Although we do not need to write that code, we can take advantage of its capability by importing its module. A library contains a collection of interconnected modules. And we import modules from their libraries whenever we need to use them. Because of Python's basic syntax, it's a fairly simple job to do. We just need to use import.
</p>
<h3>Implementation of Library
</h3>
<p>We will write code of library in a python file. All the classes and methods of library will be in this file and these classes and methods will be reused by developer for their application. At the end of the file we will have if statement if__name__= ‘main’ The statement under this condition will be executed when this file is executed standalone as a script, otherwise this file is used as module.</p>
