<h3>Control Plane</h3>
<p>The control plane consists of the components that make global decisions about the cluster (for example, scheduling and deployment),
 as well as detecting and responding to cluster events (for example, starting up a new pod when a Deployment's replicas field is unsatisfied).</p>
<p>Control plane components can be run on any machine in the cluster.</p>
<p>However, for simplicity, setup scripts typically start all control plane components on the same machine,
 and do not run user containers on this machine.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/high-availability/">
  Creating Highly Available clusters with kubeadm</a> 
  for an example control plane setup that runs across multiple machines.
  A brief intro is given here:

<h3>Creating Highly Available Clusters with kubeadm</h3>
There are two different approaches to setting up a highly available Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm:
<ul>
<li>With stacked control plane nodes. This approach requires less infrastructure. The etcd members and control plane nodes are co-located.</li>
<li>With an external etcd cluster. This approach requires more infrastructure. The control plane nodes and etcd members are separated.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Before proceeding, you should carefully consider which approach best meets the needs of your applications and environment.
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/ha-topology/">Options for Highly Available topology</a>
 outlines the advantages and disadvantages of each.</p>
