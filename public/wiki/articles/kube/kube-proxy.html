<h3>kube-proxy</h3>
<p>kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster, implementing part of the Kubernetes Service concept.</p>
<p>kube-proxy maintains network rules on nodes. These network rules allow network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster.</p>
<p>kube-proxy uses the operating system packet filtering layer if there is one and it's available. Otherwise, kube-proxy forwards the traffic itself.</p>
