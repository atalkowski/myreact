<h3>ABOUT KHAN ACADEMY</h3>
<p>Khan Academy is a nonprofit with the mission to deliver a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere. Our proven learning platform offers free, high-quality supplemental learning content and practice that cover Pre-K - 12th grade and early college core academic subjects, focusing on math and science. We have over 155 million registered learners globally and are committed to improving learning outcomes for students worldwide, focusing on learners in historically under-resourced communities.
</p>
<p>Our students, teachers, and parents come from all walks of life, and so do we. Our team includes people from academia, traditional/non-traditional education, big tech companies, and tiny startups. We hire great people from diverse backgrounds and experiences because it makes our company stronger. We value diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging as necessary to achieve our mission and impact the communities we serve. We know that transforming education starts in-house with learning about ourselves and our colleagues. We strive to be world-class in investing in our people and commit to developing you as a professional.
</p>

<h3>THE ROLE</h3>
<p>Currently we are focused on providing equitable solutions to historically under-resourced communities of learners and teachers, and guided by our Engineering Principles. On the Product team, you might work on projects such as:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Integrating state of the art learning science into our product to enable learners and teachers to quickly identify and address learning gaps on the fly.</li>
 <li>Partnering with public school districts with a high percentage of Free and Reduced Price Lunch students to build and scale our teacher and learner tools to millions of learners who otherwise would not have discovered us.</li>
 <li>Building tools for teachers to use Khan Academy as a strategic supplement in their classrooms.</li>
 <li>With the recent launch of Khanmigo and Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a technology, this role will help harness the power of AI to deliver the product capabilities where applicable.</li>
 <li>We are a remote-first organization and we strive to build using technology that is best suited to solving problems for our learners. Currently, we build with Go, GraphQL, JavaScript, React & React Native, Redux and we adopt new technologies like LLMs when they’ll help us better achieve our goals. At Khan, one of our values is “Cultivate Learning Mindsets”, so for us, it’s important that we’re working with all of our engineers to help match the right opportunity to the right individual, in order to ensure every engineer is operating at their “learning edge”.</li>
