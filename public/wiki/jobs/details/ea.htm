<p>Our ability to create meaningful change starts with our people. What we have achieved is a direct result of our amazing 
  and determined teams. Even when we were not physically together, we continued our commitments to make a positive impact

  <li>We continued to prioritize our employees well-being, with expanded employee health and wellness resources and benefit programs, including $32.5 million in support payments for pandemic-related expenses.</li>

 </ul>
 <p>While we’re proud of the progress being made on these important initiatives, this is an ongoing journey.
   We continue to hold ourselves accountable to our commitments, and transparently sharing our results.
