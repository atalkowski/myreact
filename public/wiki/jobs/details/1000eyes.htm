<h1>Senior Software Engineer, Cloud and Enterprise Agents</h1>
<h3>San Francisco, CA</h3>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>The name ThousandEyes was born from two big ideas: the power to see things not ordinarily possible and the ability to collect insights from a multitude of vantage points. As the world continues its digital transformation and relies more on cloud services and the Internet, the "network," which is now both public and private, has become a black box our customers cannot see or understand.</p>

<p>Our Internet and cloud intelligence platform delivers the only collectively powered real-time view of the Internet and private networks, cloud, and SaaS platforms, helping enterprises and service providers identify problems before they impact revenue, damage brand reputation, or halt employee productivity.</p>

<p>In August 2020, Cisco Systems completed the acquisition of ThousandEyes, which now forms the ThousandEyes Business Unit within the Cisco Networking Business Group and is the Network Assurance solution for Cisco across the Cisco Networking Cloud and Cisco Security Cloud.</p>


<h3>About the Role</h3>

<p>The goal of the cloud and enterprise agents data platform is to provide customers end-to-end visibility into infrastructure (cloud or native), applications, networks, the Internet, and everything in between. With ThousandEyes' unprecedented visibility into application and internet performance, we can help root cause issues that are impacting business-critical experiences and give customers confidence in their ability to solve issues and deliver stellar experiences.</p>


<h3>What You'll Do:</h3>

<p>As a part of this team, you will build the platform that helps us scale the ThousandEyes platform for the next 10x growth. The cloud and enterprise agents platform exposes fine-grained telemetry data to customers and partners for the ThousandEyes platform that are collected from our agent platform. You will contribute to building robust and scalable data pipelines, real-time enrichments for our customers and micro-services that support business workflows. You will provide architectural oversight and review to continually improve customer experiences and ensure service are able to meet their SLA targets.</p>
