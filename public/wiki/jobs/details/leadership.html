<H1>Leadership skills</H1>
These skills can be applied anywhere from a sport’s field to the classroom to your home life.  You don’t have to have a “position” to apply these life skills to your everyday routine.

<ul><li>Passion: When you truly care about something, others can tell. You make it a priority.</li>
<li>Set the example: If you expect guidelines to be followed, you must be the one that paves the way.
Talk less, listen more: When you listen, you’re more likely to hear and understand the underlying issues.
Motivation: It’s one thing to have ideas; it’s another one to act and follow through. When morale gets low, it’s important to be the one who keeps people going.
Trustworthiness: Your team must know they can depend on you to have their best interest at heart. Building trust takes time and can be hard to earn back once it is lost.
Flexibility: Things happen. Plans change. Being open minded and accepting the idea of taking a different path show adaptability.</li>
