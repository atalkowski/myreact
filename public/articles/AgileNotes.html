  <h1>Agile overview</h1>
  <h2>THE FOUR MAIN PRINCIPLES</h2>

<h3>1. Individuals and Interactions versus Processes and Tools</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>People respond to business needs and drive the development process</li>
    <li>When process/tools drive development, the team is less responsive to change =&gt; less likely to meet customer needs. </li>
    <li>Communication is a good example - it should happen as the need arises</li>
    <li>When using process - communication is scheduled and requires specific content - slowing and bloating the information - ultimately less effective and less efficient.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>2. Working Software versus Comprehensive Documentation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Enormous amounts of time used to be spent on documenting product, development and delivery</li>
    <li>Agile streamlines all this - gives developer enough to do the work without getting bogged down in the minutiae</li>
    <li>Agile documents <b>requirements as user stories</b>, which are sufficient</li>
    <li>Agile Manifesto values documentation, but it values working software more</li>
  </ul>

<h3>3. Customer Collaboration versus Contract Negotiation</h3>

Negotiation is the period when the customer and the product manager work out the details of a delivery, with points along the way where the details may be renegotiated. Collaboration is a different creature entirely. With development models such as Waterfall, customers negotiate the requirements for the product, often in great detail, prior to any work starting. This meant the customer was involved in the process of development before development began and after it was completed, but not during the process. The Agile Manifesto describes a customer who is engaged and collaborates throughout the development process. This makes it far easier for development to meet their needs of the customer. Agile methods may include the customer at intervals for periodic demos, but a project could just as easily have an end-user as a daily part of the team and attending all meetings, ensuring the product meets the business needs of the customer.
  <ul>
    <li>Traditional - negotiate the details beforehand typically in great detail involves customer only at beginning and end.</li>
    <li>Agile - engages with the customer and collaberates throughout the development - making it easier to meet customer needs.</li>
    <li>Tackles the issue of "Customer will know what she wants when she actually sees it".  The customer of course is always right but needs to be guided in what she thinks.</li>
  </ul>


<h3>4. Responding to Change versus Following a Plan</h3>
Traditional software development regarded change as an expense, so it was to be avoided. The intention was to develop detailed, elaborate plans, with a defined set of features and with everything, generally, having as high a priority as everything else, and with a large number of many dependencies on delivering in a certain order so that the team can work on the next piece of the puzzle.

With Agile, the shortness of an iteration means priorities can be shifted from iteration to iteration and new features can be added into the next iteration. Agile’s view is that changes always improve a project; changes provide additional value.

Perhaps nothing illustrates Agile’s positive approach to change better than the concept of Method Tailoring, defined in An Agile Information Systems Development Method in use as: “A process or capability in which human agents determine a system development approach for a specific project situation through responsive changes in, and dynamic interplays between contexts, intentions, and method fragments.” Agile methodologies allow the Agile team to modify the process and make it fit the team rather than the other way around.
  <ul>
    <li>Traditional - change is expensive - so build a plan beforehand with all details negotiated - but this is found not to deliver great products.</li>
    <li>Agile - change is inevitable - iterate over shorter delivery goals and respond to change</li>
  </ul>

<h2>THE TWELVE AGILE MANIFESTO PRINCIPLES</h2>
The Twelve Principles are the guiding principles for the methodologies that are included under the title “The Agile Movement.” They describe a culture in which change is welcome, and the customer is the focus of the work. They also demonstrate the movement’s intent as described by Alistair Cockburn, one of the signatories to the Agile Manifesto, which is to bring development into alignment with business needs.

  <ul>
    <li><b>Customer satisfaction through early and continuous software delivery</b> - Customers are happier when they receive working software at regular intervals, rather than waiting extended periods of time between releases.</li>
    <li><b>Accommodate changing requirements throughout the development process</b> - The ability to avoid delays when a requirement or feature request changes.</li>
    <li><b>Frequent delivery of working software</b> - Scrum accommodates this principle since the team operates in software sprints or iterations that ensure regular delivery of working software.</li>
    <li><b>Collaboration between the business stakeholders and developers throughout the project</b> - Better decisions are made when the business and technical team are aligned.</li>
    <li><b>Support, trust, and motivate the people involved</b> - Motivated teams are more likely to deliver their best work than unhappy teams.</li>
    <li><b>Enable face-to-face interactions</b> - Communication is more successful when development teams are co-located.</li>
    <li><b>Working software is the primary measure of progress</b> - Delivering functional software to the customer is the ultimate factor that measures progress.</li>
    <li><b>Agile processes to support a consistent development pace</b> - Teams establish a repeatable and maintainable speed at which they can deliver working software, and they repeat it with each release.</li>
    <li><b>Attention to technical detail and design enhances agility</b> - The right skills and good design ensures the team can maintain the pace, constantly improve the product, and sustain change.</li>
    <li><b>Simplicity</b> - Develop just enough to get the job done for right now.</li>
    <li><b>Self-organizing teams encourage great architectures, requirements, and designs</b> - Skilled and motivated team members who have decision-making power, take ownership, communicate regularly with other team members, and share ideas that deliver quality products.</li>
    <li><b>Regular reflections on how to become more effective</b> - Self-improvement, process improvement, advancing skills, and techniques help team members work more efficiently.</li>
  </ul>
The intention of Agile is to align development with business needs, and the success of Agile is apparent. Agile projects are customer focused and encourage customer guidance and participation. As a result, Agile has grown to be an overarching view of software development throughout the software industry and an industry all by itself.
