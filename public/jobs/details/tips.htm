<h3>Tips: Person skills</h3>
  <p>Courtesy of Arnie Schartzenigger. 
    These skills can be applied anywhere from a sport’s field to the classroom to your work to your home life. 
   You don’t have to have a “position” to apply these life skills to your everyday routine.
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Passion</b>: When you truly care about something, others can tell. You make it a priority.</li>
  <li><b>Set the example</b>: If you expect guidelines to be followed, you must be the one that paves the way.</li>
  <li><b>Talk less, listen more</b>: When you listen, you’re more likely to hear and understand the underlying issues.</li>
  <li><b>Motivation</b>: It’s one thing to have ideas; it’s another one to act and follow through. When morale gets low, it’s important to be the one who keeps people going.</li>
  <li><b>Trustworthiness</b>: Your team must know they can depend on you to have their best interest at heart. Building trust takes time and can be hard to earn back once it is lost.</li>
  <li><b>Flexibility</b>: Things happen. Plans change. Being open minded and accepting the idea of taking a different path show adaptability.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tips: From an EA designer</h3>
<h4>What does he look for in a Quality Designer?</h4>
<ul>
<li>I'm looking for someone who has a strong desire to learn and to grow with us. It is important for external candidates to take time to understand how the team works and learn how a game is built before influencing a change.</li>
<li>I’d like to see candidates with a diverse skill set and experience who can integrate their past learnings and 
  analyze the landscape before applying changes to how it should be done.
</li>
</ul>
 The second attribute he says he is looking for is the ability to analyze scenarios supported by data or experience before execution and to ask questions.
<ul>   
<li>Showing the ability to learn and to be inquisitive is most important during an interview</li>
<li>I want to know if a candidate can articulate how they would solve a problem whether it’s from a past experience or a fictitious scenario. A candidate doesn’t have to fulfill every requirement but rather for the candidate to demonstrate how they would critically think and respond to scenarios.</li>
</ul>

<p>Team members are empowered to lean into their strengths</p>
<p>His team is all about empowerment, the ability to openly suggest ideas, question norms, challenge processes,
   and lean into strengths. A problem can be solved in many ways 
   “so let’s empower our employees to solve the problem the best way they know how to and to do so in a creative and autonomous way."

<h3>Advice from another EA exec</h3>
  <p>It's really important that we all define our own personal success metrics and, yes, we should get feedback
  from our leaders, teams, and peers and take that into account, but at the end of it,
   if you're only successful by someone else's definition, you will fail.</p>
  <p>Part of your own success needs to be making you happy and <b>following what matters to you.</b></p>
  </p>
  <p>We should take a lot more time and be very mindful of what it is that we want as individuals and 
    then try to align our lives with that.</p>
  <p>Why this resonates with me is based on so many years doing what others need me to do - which has allowed
    me to learn, grow, get paid and be successful - up to a point. But looking back I see that that my best work
    was because I am always thinking outside the box with curiosity and often naivety - and it has lead to some of
    the best work I have done.</p>
  <p>Like my facination for understanding how a compiler works - leading to my building a report generator with an in built
    language so that colleagues (and customers) could easily set up their own amazing reports.</p>
