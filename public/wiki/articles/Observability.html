  <h3>Brief</h3>
  <div id="detail_log1" class="grayback100">
    Cloud Logging allows you to centralize, aggregate, and manage logs from sources on the cloud. 
    It allows you to collect, correlate, and analyze logs from all over your stack, identify bottlenecks, measure performance,
    and tweak the configuration. This is all to say that having a logging tool in your arsenal to help you identify important
    metrics within your cloud is crucial for the security, longevity, and utilization of the data you have stored in the cloud.

  <h3>Guidewire observability intro</h3>
  <p>For any cloud platform, observability refers to the ability to gain insight into the internal state and behavior of the platform’s
    infrastructure components, services, and applications. It is a growing focus area in the industry because it helps operators and developers
    detect issues and make faster decisions that lead to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>improved platform performance,</li>
    <li>improved reliability,</li>
    <li>improved security,</li>
    <li>improved customer experience</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Most observability tools are comprised of three (3) core components: </p>   
  <ul>
  <li><b>Logs</b>, which are a record of operational events that have occurred within the platform</li>
  <li><b>Metrics</b>, which are quantitative measurements of the system’s performance or behavior</li>
  <li><b>Traces</b>, which provide visibility into the flow of requests and transactions throughout the platform</li>
  </ul>
