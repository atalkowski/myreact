<h3>Node - a real or virtual machine</h3>
<p>Kubernetes runs your workload by placing containers into Pods to run on Nodes. A node may be a virtual or physical machine,
   depending on the cluster. Each node is managed by the <b>control plane</b> and contains the services (kubelet and kube-proxy) 
   necessary to run Pods.</p>
<p>Typically you have several nodes in a cluster; in a learning or resource-limited environment, you might have only one node.</p>
<p>The components on a node include the <b>kubelet</b>, a <b>container runtime</b>, and the <b>kube-proxy</b>.</p>

<h3>Management</h3>
<p>There are two main ways to have Nodes added to the API server:</p>
<ul>
The kubelet on a node self-registers to the control plane
You (or another human user) manually add a Node object
</ul>
After you create a Node object, or the kubelet on a node self-registers, the control plane checks whether the new Node object is valid. For example, if you try to create a Node from the following JSON manifest:
<div class="codeblock">
{
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;"kind": "Node",
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;"apiVersion": "v1",
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;"metadata": {
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "10.240.79.157",
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"labels": {
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "my-first-k8s-node"
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;}
<br/>}
</div>
<p>
Kubernetes creates a Node object internally (the representation).
Kubernetes checks that a kubelet has registered to the API server that matches the metadata.name field of the Node. 
If the node is healthy (i.e. all necessary services are running), then it is eligible to run a Pod. 
Otherwise, that node is ignored for any cluster activity until it becomes healthy.
</p>
<h4>Note:</h4>
<p>Kubernetes keeps the object for the invalid Node and continues checking to see whether it becomes healthy.</p>
<p>You, or a controller, must explicitly delete the Node object to stop that health checking.</p>
<p>The name of a Node object must be a valid DNS subdomain name.</p>

<h3>Node name uniqueness</h3>
<p>The name identifies a Node. Two Nodes cannot have the same name at the same time.
   Kubernetes also assumes that a resource with the same name is the same object. 
   In case of a Node, it is implicitly assumed that an instance using the same name will have the same state (e.g. network settings,
   root disk contents) and attributes like node labels. This may lead to inconsistencies if an instance was modified
   without changing its name. If the Node needs to be replaced or updated significantly, 
   the existing Node object needs to be removed from API server first and re-added after the update.</p>

<h3>Self-registration of Nodes</h3>
<p>When the kubelet flag --register-node is true (the default), the kubelet will attempt to register itself with the API server. 
This is the preferred pattern, used by most distros.</p>
<p>
For self-registration, the kubelet is started with the following options:</p>
<ul>
--kubeconfig - Path to credentials to authenticate itself to the API server.
--cloud-provider - How to talk to a cloud provider to read metadata about itself.
--register-node - Automatically register with the API server.
--register-with-taints - Register the node with the given list of taints (comma separated &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;:&lt;effect&gt;).
No-op if register-node is false.
--node-ip - Optional comma-separated list of the IP addresses for the node. You can only specify a single address for each address family. For example, in a single-stack IPv4 cluster, you set this value to be the IPv4 address that the kubelet should use for the node. See configure IPv4/IPv6 dual stack for details of running a dual-stack cluster.
If you don't provide this argument, the kubelet uses the node's default IPv4 address, if any; if the node has no IPv4 addresses then the kubelet uses the node's default IPv6 address.
--node-labels - Labels to add when registering the node in the cluster (see label restrictions enforced by the NodeRestriction admission plugin).
--node-status-update-frequency - Specifies how often kubelet posts its node status to the API server.
When the Node authorization mode and NodeRestriction admission plugin are enabled, kubelets are only authorized to create/modify their own Node resource.
</ul>

<h3>Note:</h3>
<p>As mentioned in the Node name uniqueness section, when Node configuration needs to be updated,
   it is a good practice to re-register the node with the API server. For example, 
   if the kubelet is being restarted with a new set of --node-labels, but the same Node name is used, 
  the change will not take effect, as labels are only set (or modified) upon Node registration with the API server.</p>
  <p>Pods already scheduled on the Node may misbehave or cause issues if the Node configuration will be changed on kubelet restart.
   For example, already running Pod may be tainted against the new labels assigned to the Node, while other Pods,
   that are incompatible with that Pod will be scheduled based on this new label.
   Node re-registration ensures all Pods will be drained and properly re-scheduled.</p>

<h3>Manual Node administration</h3>
You can create and modify Node objects using kubectl.
When you want to create Node objects manually, set the kubelet flag --register-node=false.
You can modify Node objects regardless of the setting of --register-node. For example, you can set labels on an existing Node or mark it unschedulable.
You can use labels on Nodes in conjunction with node selectors on Pods to control scheduling. For example, you can constrain a Pod to only be eligible to run on a subset of the available nodes.
Marking a node as unschedulable prevents the scheduler from placing new pods onto that Node but does not affect existing Pods on the Node. This is useful as a preparatory step before a node reboot or other maintenance.

To mark a Node unschedulable, run:

kubectl cordon $NODENAME
