These define the essential components of an OAuth 2.0 system, and are as follows:<br/>

<b>Resource Owner:</b> The user or system that owns the protected resources and can grant access to them.<br/>

<b>Client:</b> The client is the system that requires access to the protected resources. To access resources, the Client must hold the appropriate Access Token.<br/>

<b>Authorization Server:</b> This server receives requests from the Client for Access Tokens and issues them upon successful authentication and consent by the Resource Owner. The authorization server exposes two endpoints: the Authorization endpoint, which handles the interactive authentication and consent of the user, and the Token endpoint, which is involved in a machine to machine interaction.<br/>

<b>Resource Server:</b> A server that protects the userâ€™s resources and receives access requests from the Client. It accepts and validates an Access Token from the Client and returns the appropriate resources to it.
