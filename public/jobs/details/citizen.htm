<h1>Senior Backend Engineer - Citizen</h1>
<h3>San Francisco Bay Area</h3>
<h3>About the job and Citizen</h3>
<p>Citizen is the No. 1 public safety app in the U.S., with a mission to make the world a safer place. Citizen provides 911 alerts so
 people can use their phones to keep themselves, and the people and places they love, safe. Citizen has notified people to evacuate burning buildings,
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;deterred school buses from nearby terrorist attacks, and led to the rescue of kidnapped children and missing people. 
</p>
<p>Citizen’s 911 alerts are accompanied by live stories, real-time updates, and user-generated content so app users never have to wonder 
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;why there are helicopters overhead or fire engines passing by. By broadcasting from the scene of an incident, communicating with one another,
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; and reading live updates, communities are empowered by Citizen. We act fast, break news, and give people the immediate information they need
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to stay safe. And we’re just getting started.
</p>
<p>Our paid products—Citizen Protect and Citizen Plus, enhance the Citizen experience by offering users powerful features like police scanner radio, historical incidents, custom alerts zones, and access to a digital guardian 24/7 help. Subscribers have used Citizen Protect to de-escalate tense domestic situations, guide emergency response to remote hiking locations, travel safely on late-night walks and Ubers.
</p>

<p>Already relied on by millions of people every day, Citizen will expand even further across the United States this year to keep more users safe and informed. We’re looking for hardworking, mission-driven individuals to help bring Citizen to hundreds of cities nationwide.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Citizen is backed by 8VC, Founders Fund, Goodwater Capital, and Greycroft and has raised $100M+ in VC funding.
